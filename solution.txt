 Q. What is the difference between git stash apply and git stash pop?
1) If you want to apply your top stashed changes to current non-staged change and delete that stash as well, then you should go for git stash pop.
But if you are want to apply your top stashed changes to current non-staged change without deleting it, then you should go for git stash apply.

2) The git stash apply command leaves the topmost stash on the stash list so that we can later use it, on the other hand, 
the git stash pop command removes or throw away the latest or the topmost stash.
